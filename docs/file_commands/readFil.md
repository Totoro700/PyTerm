# readFil

The `readFil` command opens a regular text file (for opening *binary* files, look for `openBinFil.md`). It will ask for the **full** file name, like `text.txt` ***OR*** the full file directory, like `C:\Scripts\main.py` (you can use forward slashes ( `/` ) instead of backslashes ( `\` )), once you press `enter`, it will print ***ALL*** text in the file



```
> readFil
Full file name or directory? (eg. "text.txt" or "C:\\Python\\python.py")
C:\text.txt
Hello!
This example text is from the file text.txt!
> 
```
