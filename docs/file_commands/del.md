# del

The `del` command deletes a file. If you input `text.txt` as the file, and there is no `text.txt` file next to the program, it will print `The file does not exist!`, else, it will print `Successfully deleted text.txt`

```
> del
Full file name to delete? (eg. "text.txt")

The file does not exist!
```

***OR***

```
> del
Full file name to delete? (eg. "text.txt")
text.txt
Successfully deleted text.txt

```
