When you first startup PyTerm you should see something like this:

```
@------------------------------------------------------------------------------------@
|                                                                                    |
|                                  |PyTerm v0.4.3|                                   |
|                                                                                    |
@------------------------------------------------------------------------------------@
>
```

Which is great!



Now to get some commands you can use, type `help`



If you want to exit, type `exit` or `terminate`, it should close once you press `enter`. You can also press `Ctrl` + `C` ( `âŒ˜` + `C`  for Mac OS X)
